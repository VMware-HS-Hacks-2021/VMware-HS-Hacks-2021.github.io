* It should be able to show events near by and exercises that can be used to calm people down.
* It should be able to notify people whenever the website feels the person needs to relax.
* It could have an option to put personal interests in order to filter events 
  * It needs to collect user information to guess potential events the user may have an interest in  
* Could have a way to differentiate individual stress exercises and group event?
* It could have an option to show different exercises based on the stress levels they have at the given time
How will it guess stress levels?
* it will ask how streeful that person feels on a scale of 1 to 10 
* a possible reward system for completing each exercise/event
* Some sort of age filter so users can be part of a group of similar age (ie: kid events, adult events)


What counts as the core project?

Should come up with solution statement and find focus.

* We want a website that takes users' personal interests to create healthy, enjoyable, and stress-reducing exercises for all ages and recommend a sample schedule for them.


Maybe condense the rewards system?
