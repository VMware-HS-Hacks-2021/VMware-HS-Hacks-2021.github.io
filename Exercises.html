      <h2> Running </h2>
    <p> Running regularly can provide consistent boosts to your overall feelings of happiness. Running can be a method of making your body and mind feel better. Each of the following are positive benefits of running for your mental health:</p>

    <p>1) Running reduces stress. After running, a biochemical substance known as endocannabinoids are released into your body. When endocannabinoids enter your body, it flows through your bloodstream and eventually enters the brain, which will provide feelings of reduced stress and calmness.</p>

    <p>2) Running also boosts your mood. When you run, blood circulation to the brain is increased and the part of your brain that responds to stress and improves your mood is affected. This causes a change that temporarily improves your reaction to stressful situations.</p>

    <p>3) Running helps you recover from mental health issues. Some studies show that regular running can have the same effects as medication in relieving symptoms of anxiety and depression. Running is encouraged during therapy and recovery to alleviate some symptoms of mental illness.</p>

    <p>4) Running improves sleep. Running has been shown to help you set a normal sleep schedule. Chemicals released during and after running relax your body and encourage deep sleeping. Having a regular sleep schedule is good for your brain and improves your mental health.</p>
