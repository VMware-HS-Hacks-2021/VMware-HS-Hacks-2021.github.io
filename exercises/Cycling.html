    <p> Cycling is the perfect choice of because it allows us to do something good for our shape while we're on the move. This means that we don't have to make time for our training session, we can turn our road to class into exercise.
</p>

    <p>1) Cycling reduces stress: The repetitive action of pedaling involved in cycling can help your brain release outside stresses in the same way that mediating on a phrase or a word is used in classical mediation. By focusing on your pedal stoke you can block out other worries and stresses of the day, giving your brain a break from all of your daily problems.

</p>

    <p>2) Getting out into nature: When you find a peaceful hill to climb, or even when cycling through a quiet neighborhood, you have the opportunity to be out in nature. Being exposed to the natural elements of cold or heat and feeling the wind is another way to release the stressful thoughts and focus on things outside of ourselves.

</p>

    <p>3)More enjoyment equals less stress: Whether you are the type of rider who likes to spend hours riding alone, you love to meet all of the guys for the big, early morning ride at the local coffee house or you like training for a competition, riding is more than exercise, it is fun.</p>
